== Description ==

Export orders from the [WP e-Commerce Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) as DTA File. This fileformat is used in Germany to exchange information about money transactions with banks or online banking programs. It uses the DTA class written by [Hermann Stainer](http://www.web-gear.com/). It automatically remembers the last exported order to avoid double payments.

The plugin needs PHP 5+.
